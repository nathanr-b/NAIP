For use with Sillburp when parameterizing thermogenic methane release (note that the parameterization results are included within the modified dim2mtp.awk file):

sillburp.H

Source code used for building Sillburp. Modified so that the product of labile kerogen maturation is gas only. 

collate_aureole.gmt
Script to collate, contour and plot the aureole thickness power law parameter. Modified so that the gas generated by cracking of oil is ignored and only the masses from direct cracking of kerogen to gas are included in the collated results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
For use with LIPburp when calculating emissions histories for the NAIP:

dim2mtp.awk
Converts sill dimension list from make_dimensions.awk into the 3 parameters required by the tapered power-law emissions parameterisation developed in Jea19. Was modified to include the parameterisation results obtained by building sillburp with the modified sillburp.H file and using collate_aureole.gmt for collating results.
